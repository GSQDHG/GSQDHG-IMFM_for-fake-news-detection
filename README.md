# IMFM：Integrate Multi-Dimentional Frequency Features with Multi-Task Learning for Fake News Detection
#We will upload the complete code and dataset after the paper review process has concluded.

## Introduction


The proposed IMFM is a Fake News Detection framework, which could tackle multi-dimentional frequency features by multi-task learning to achieve better performance.
This project is an improvement of Project [FTT](https://github.com/ICTMCG/FTT-ACL23).

## Dataset

Due to review requirements, we cannot release the complete dataset at the moment. We have placed test dataset at `roll_seasonal_data/NDMF_for_paper_review`  so you can test the model. You can create your own dataset following the sample format.

## Code

### Requirements

Refer to requirements.txt

You can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to deploy the environment quickly.

### Pretrained Models

We provide models for each season at `param_model` .

### Run


Parameter Configuration:

--gpu 0
--epoch 50
--lr 3e-04
--model_name bert
--root_path reweight_roll_season\roll_seasonal_user_data\NDMF_for_paper_review_SBERT-sg-1.2_prophet-bsr-100_sw-100.0-0.5-1.5
--bert_path .\pre_train_model\bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment
--data_name NDMF_for_paper_review_SBERT-sg-1.2_prophet-bsr-100_sw-100.0-0.5-1.5
--data_type roll_online
--split_level seasonal

You can  complete the testing process running the main.py.
